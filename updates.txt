How to merge quality #482
- NEW: Guide in Radarr Tips section, covering how to merge qualities.

(*) The Notifiarr project has become that huge that i'm not able to cover everything and every change/update/addition to it, and i don't use all of the options it offers. So I decided with the developer that i will remove it from the guide for now being it's to outdated and will create a new one only covering the TRaSH Guide Sync option.
