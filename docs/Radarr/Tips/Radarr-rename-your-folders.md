Select `Yes, Move the files`

!!! warning
    If you have a large library, remote storage, cloud storage, or your path structure isn't well planned or doesn't support instant moves, then this process could take a while. Make sure you don't interrupt this process. If it stops before it's complete, it could result in quite the mess.

Then Magic

As you can see the folder has been renamed to the correct year following your naming scheme.
