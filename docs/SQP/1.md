# Streaming Optimized

!!! note
    Keep in mind this SQP is a WIP. Changes are done when needed.

    It uses Custom Formats and specific settings that will probably never make it to the guide, being the guide is used by the masses and what's used here is made for specific needs.

    This also means some Custom Formats needs manual updating or you can use one of the 3rd party automation tools.

[^1]:
    If you don't mind to get also other Bluray Encodes (less or not streaming optimized) then you could lower this score to 10.
