# Streaming Optimized

!!! note
    Keep in mind this SQP is a WIP, Changes are done when needed.

    It uses Custom Formats and specific needed settings that probably will never make it to the guide, being the guide is used by the mass and what's used here is specific made.

    This also means some Custom Formats needs manual updating or you can use one of the 3rd party automation tools.

    If you don't mind to get also other Bluray Encodes (less or not streaming optimized) then you could lower this score to 10.
