# Streaming Optimized

This release profile is fine tuned when you want to run a 2nd Radarr for 1080p, and want minimum to none transcoding and smaller sizes for the second copy's

It will prefer 1080p BHDStudio releases, if no BHDStudio can be found it will prefer HQ WEB-DL

BHDStudio does HQ 1080p Encodes with the following features

+ Streaming optimized (Optimized for PLEX, emby, Jellyfin, and other streaming platforms)
+ Small sizes
+ Good quality
-  No DoVi
- Only AC3 Audio (Downmixed Lossless audio track to Dolby Digital 5.1 for optimal compatibility)

=========[Why choose this quality profile?]=========

- You want maximum compatibility between all devices and still a HQ releases.
- You run 2 instances of Radarr and want both version or just for the 1080p ones.
- You want to have minimum till none transcoding for low powered devices or remote streaming.
- If available for you Streaming optimized (Optimized for PLEX, emby, Jellyfin, and other streaming platforms)
- Small sizes

==================[NOTE]==================

 Just keep in mind it's still a WIP and i tinker/test with it daily, meaning changes happen often to fine tune it.

it even uses Custom Formats not on the Guide and probably will never make it to the guide, being the guide is used by the mass and what i'm using is really specific made.

this also means the custom formats needs manual updating or you can use notifiarr patron feature to keep them in automatically in sync.

 STEP #2

Change the 1080p Quality Size to the range BHDStudio uses ( I searched BHD to check what was their smallest and biggest release, so this can change later if needed)

WEBDL/WEBRip1080p = 25.2 - 85.7
Bluray-1080p = 33.8 - 102 (Min = 2 GB/h  - Max = 6 GB/h )

 If you notice issues with the sizes please report  (edited)
