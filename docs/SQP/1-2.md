# UHD WEBDL REMUX HQ-Encodes

!!! note
    Keep in mind this SQP is a WIP, Changes are done when needed.

    It uses Custom Formats and specific needed settings that probably will never make it to the guide, being the guide is used by the mass and what's used here is specific made.

    This also means some Custom Formats needs manual updating or you can use one of the 3rd party automation tools.

    !!! hint
        `[DV WEBDL]` = This custom format you need to score depending of your personal use.

        If you only watch your movies on a setup that completely supports Dolby Vision from start to end then give it a score of 0 or just don't add it, if you also got a setup that doesn't support Dolby Vision then you should add this with a score of `-10000`
