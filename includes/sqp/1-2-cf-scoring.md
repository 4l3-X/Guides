    !!! hint
        `[DV WEBDL]` = This custom format you need to score depending of your personal use.

        If you only watch your movies on a setup that completely supports Dolby Vision from start to end then give it a score of 0 or just don't add it, if you also got a setup that doesn't support Dolby Vision then you should add this with a score of `-10000`
