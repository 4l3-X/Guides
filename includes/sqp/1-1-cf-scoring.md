    !!! hint
        `[DV WEBDL]` = This custom format you need to score depending of your personal use.

        If you only watch your movies on a setup that completely supports Dolby Vision from start to end then give it a score of 0 or just don't add it, if you also got a setup that doesn't support Dolby Vision then you should add this with a score of `-10000`

### Quality Size

`Settings` => `Quality`

Change the 1080p Quality Size to the range BHDStudio uses ( I searched BHD to check what was their smallest and biggest release, so this can change later if needed)

If you notice issues with the sizes please report it.

| Quality        | Min   | Preferred | Max  |
| -------------- | ----- | --------- | ---- |
| WEBDL-1080p    |  25.2 |      84.7 | 85.7 |
| WEBRip-1080p   |  25.2 |      84.7 | 85.7 |
| Bluray-720p    |  25.2 |       101 | 102  |
| Bluray-1080p   |  33.8 |       101 | 102  |
